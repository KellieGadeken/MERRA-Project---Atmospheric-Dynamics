# MERRA-Project---Atmospheric-Dynamics
MERRA data project for atmospheric dynamics class to perform scale analysis at 50N (Midlatitude) and 5N (Tropics)

Code is a bit messy. 

Starts with scale analysis for 50N, prints table of values for momentum equation. Option to uncomment terms for continuity and thermodynamic to get values.

Then calculates scale analysis for 5N, prints table of values for momentum equation with again the option to uncomment terms for continuity and thermodynamic values.

Ends with script to plot 3 figures:
1) X Y Z Momentum time series
2) Continuity and thermodynamic time series
3) Avg value for each term in X Y Z momentum equation
(each plot has values for both 50N and 5N)
